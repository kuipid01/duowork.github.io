## Background

Larks Podcast is a contemporary podcast that's more about the "laffs" than the "feels" and it wanted a modern web app for its web presence and allow to listeners to stream its podcast episode online. The web app consists of three pages: Home, Episodes, and About, and was built modern web technoligies: NextJS, TypeScript, and GraphQL.

## Challenge

Larks wanted a modern, sleek, and simple-looking user interface that matched its brand and allowed their listeners to easily navigate and access their podcast episodes. Additionally, the client needed a custom audio player that was fully customizable and matched the website's design and branding.

## Solution

Duowork was tasked with bringing to life the client's expectation. First the team took note and ananlyzed the the requirements then moved on to mocking the app's user interface design. The development team worked closely with Larks Podcast design a modern, sleek and simple-looking interface that matched its brand and provided a seamless user experience for its listeners.

The user interface design incorporated a clean layout, easy-to-use navigation, and consistent branding elements, including Larks' color scheme and logo. The design was optimized for both desktop and mobile devices, ensuring that listeners could access the podcast episodes from any device.

In addition, the web app needed an audio player that allowed streaming podcast episodes. This could easily have been achieved with 'built-in' technology like that HTML5 audio player or other player plugins. But the team couldn't customize those options to fit the website's branding. After much searching, the better option was to build a custom audio player from scratch. The audio player interface design had to match the website's color scheme and branding, ensuring a seamless user experience for Larks' listeners. It included advanced features such as seamless playback and volume control.

The custom audio player allowed listeners to stream podcast episodes online making it an ideal solution for Larks' needs.
