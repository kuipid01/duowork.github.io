Software is everywhere. The scope of interactions and business has changed dynamically. Any business or organization is almost only as relevant as their presence on the internet. Today businesses run their operations using software and offer products that scale over the internet. Two decades ago, only top companies and a few expert (indie hackers included) could run their businesses online. The technical expertise and means weren't as democratised as it is today. That means that starting a SaaS or online business in today's world isn't as difficult as it used to be. Anybody with a digital idea and the means (technical expertise and/or funds) to do so can transform their idea into reality. However, not everybody is a software developer, user Interface/Experience (UI/UX) designer. Also, not every body possesses expert knowledge on showing and guiding businesses how to achieve optimum productivity and success by means of using software.
