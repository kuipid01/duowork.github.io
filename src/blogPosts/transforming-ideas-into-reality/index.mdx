It can't be over-emphasised how technologically advanced the time we're living in is. The scope of interactions and business has changed dynamically and businesses are relevant as their presence on the internet. Today businesses run their operations and offer products that scale over the internet. Two decades ago, only top companies and a few indie hackers could run their businesses online. The technical expertise and means weren't as democratised as it is today. That means starting a SaaS or online business isn't as difficult as it used to be. Anybody with a digital idea and the means (technical expertise or funds) to do so can transform their idea into reality. However, not everybody is a software developer, product designer and possesses expert knowledge on how to train and guide businesses to achieve optimum productivity and success via software.
