Software development companies and agencies promise to deliver on the digital vision of entrepreneurs, businesses, startups or just about anybody that wants to put out a software product or platform. You happen t have an exciting idea that solves a particular problem and you want to get started with it right away but you don't know how or maybe you've experienced rocky start before and you'd want to prevent past bitter events from repeating itself, Not to mention the near annoying (it can be annoying) onboarding process and the discrepancies in between everything for both you and the development company. At <span className="blog-highlighted-text">Duowork</span>, we've thought about this carefully and came up with these 9 steps you, as a potential client, can follow the next you'd want to work with a development company.

- PEN DOWN CORE FEATURES AND REQUIREMENTS FOR MVP

  <p>
    This is super important because it determines the right approach to
    development. Your product or platform should, at its initial stage, only
    have the functions needed to get it off the ground. These are called _core
    features_ and they determine the _Minimum Viable Product_ (MVP) which is the
    first product (app) that is available to the market (users) for use.
    Determining core features for your app is crucial to what you want to
    achieve.
  </p>

  > When introducing your digital product to the market, talk about the problem it solves and the benefits, not the features. Essentially, features should solve problems.

  #### Here is how to determine features for your app.

  - Define the users of your app (The people you're solving the problem for.)
  - Define and priotise their goals/needs.
  - Brainstorm on how to solve the problem
  - Write down the **must-haves** (core features) features for the app.
  - **Should-have** features (Future features. Not needed to get the app off the ground.)
  - **Nice to have** features (Not necessarily because of low value.)

- CUSTOM OR PACKAGE SOFTWARE?
  <p>
  There are two to achieve what you want to build: custom solution or Packaged software. Custom software is built from scratch using code to not only match requirements but allow for the creation of future software features tailored to user needs. Package software use of-the-shell tools (CMSs like WordPress) and no/low-code platforms (like Webflow) to meet user needs. There is no better bet between the two approaches at the surface. However, careful consideration of your requirement will determine which will be a better bet.

  </p>

      <p>
      For instance, you want an e-commerce store that needs to be up and running ASAP and you are on a budget. The better approach would be to use a Packaged Sofware or use a plugin like Woocommerce or Magento on a CMS like WordPress. This software is built to already handle the normal feature of an e-commerce store so besides setup, there isn't going to be much development work for the developer. this approach is fast and cheap, but not scalable, secure and performant enough to handle the traffic. For scalability, security and performance, a custom approach is the right choice. This however isn't cheap and fast, at least not in the initial stage, but will get the job done.
      </p>

      <p>
      	At <span className="underline-color-green-light">Duowork</span>, we are primarily a custom software development company but provide cheaper development approaches for clients to get their MVP products off the ground.
      </p>

- WHAT DO YOU NEED HELP WITH?

  <p>
    This is one part that is often done shabbily! Your vision, mission and goals
    are great but only know and understand them. You need to communicate to the
    development company or agency what you want to achieve. Take the time to do
    this via a phone call, email or contact form on the company's website. Don't
    be in a rush about it. Ask questions to make sure you're understood. The
    upside to this is that the company might have built a similar app for a
    client and may have an idea or two on how to help you beyond just
    development. The downside is that your ineffective communication could bring
    about wrong implementations and friction to the development process.
  </p>

- IT'S NOT MAGIC, EVEN IT SEEMS LIKE IT ‚ú®

  <p>
    While off-the-shelf software may be faster and custom approach slower. There
    comes a time when things could be slow despite the development approach.
    However, depending on the requirements and features, the development company
    or agency should give you an estimated time that takes into account all the
    steps, nuances and possible slow-downs. usually, you'd get 1-3 months for
    small-sized apps, 3 - 6 months for medium-sized apps and 6 - 12 months for
    large-scale apps. Having determined the problem you're to solve in step 1,
    development may or may not be swift.
  </p>

- IT‚ÄôS NOT GOING TO BE CHEAP

  <p>
    Building software is generally not cheap because of the time and energy that
    goes into it. Research the costs and have a budget prepared for your
    project. Development can be challenging even for software built with
    off-the-shelf technologies. Don't go looking for a favour or cheap work.
    Your budget would have to remedy known and unforeseen challenges. So before
    engaging with a development company or agency, remember this: Budget!
    Budget!! Budget!!!
  </p>

- PROVIDE NECESSARY FILES FOR DESIGNS AND OTHER ASSETS

  <p>
    Development companies and agencies will always want to maximise their
    earnings margin by offering to do all the work (supposing they have it as
    part of their services) and they do so convincingly, it's okay to push back
    if you've done part of the work. Say you got a freelance product designer to
    create both the wireframe and the UI/UX of your app already. If so then you
    should provide the specifications and other assets (images, logos, etc) to
    the development company or agency.
  </p>

- KEEP AGREEMENT COPY

  <p>
    Papers will be signed to make sure both sides do their work and hopefully
    avoid getting sued. Yeah... it does happen! Always keep a copy of any
    agreement no matter how insignificant you may consider it to be. your work
    and the process involved in bringing it to life should be documented
    (development companies and agencies already know this). once done so,
    anything done that is contrary to what's on the document will attract a
    penalty for both parties as stated in the agreement.
  </p>

- STAY IN TOUCH AND GET UPDATES

  <p>
    Make sure to get a timeline for updates. Being told every other week about
    the progress of development is usually the norm, but certain cases differ.
    So make sure you get a timeline for updates. Usually, the project manager or
    CEO would email or call to give an update.
  </p>

- CONCLUSION

  <p>
    Working with development companies does't have to be difficult. In most
    cases the companies already have things in place but the potential client
    does not. use the steps above as a guide for a smooth relationship between
    you and the company.
