  Duowork website

This is the official [Duowork](https://www.duowork.github.io) website repository.

## 🚀 Quick start

1.  **Install NodeJS javascript runtime.**

    NodeJS v14 and above. [install instructions](https://nodejs.org/en/download).

2.  **Fork and clone the repo.**

    Create a [fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) of the codebase and clone the repo.

    ```shell
    # Clone repo
    git clone https://github.com/Duowork/duowork.github.io.git
    ```

3.  **Start developing.**

    Install the required dependencies as listed in `package.json`.

    ```shell
    # Command to install packages
    npm install
    ```

4.  **Switch git branch**

    Switch to the `v2` contribution branch. This codebase is in it's current version of v2.

    ```shell
    git branch checkout v2
    ```

    _Note: There are 4 branches: `v2`, `staging` and `main`._ The first branch is the development branch, the second is for testing. The codebase should work as expected before merging it with the last branch.

5. **Run app**
  ```shell
  gatsby develop # or 'npm run dev'
  ```

  The app will run on the address `localhost:8000`

  _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby Tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/tutorial/part-4/#use-graphiql-to-explore-the-data-layer-and-write-graphql-queries)._

## 🧐 What's inside?

A quick look at the top-level files and directories you'll in the codebase.

    .
    ├── node_modules
    ├── .github
    ├── .gitignore
    ├── .hintrc
    ├── .prettierrc
    ├── public
    ├── src
    ├── gatsby-browser.js
    ├── gatsby-config.js
    ├── gatsby-node.js
    ├── gatsby-ssr.js
    ├── postcss.config

    └── README.md

1.  **`/node_modules`**: This directory contains all of the modules of code that your project depends on (npm packages) are automatically installed.

2.  **`/src`**: This directory will contain all of the code related to what you will see on the front-end of your site (what you see in the browser) such as your site header or a page template. `src` is a convention for “source code”.

3.  **`.gitignore`**: This file tells git which files it should not track / not maintain a version history for.

4.  **`.prettierrc`**: This is a configuration file for [Prettier](https://prettier.io/). Prettier is a tool to help keep the formatting of your code consistent.

5. **`.hintrc`**: This is a configuration file for html and css linting.

6. **`.vscode`**: This is configuration for the VSCode IDE.

7. **`.github`**: This is a configuration for the Github Action pipeline. Github Action is Github's CI/CD pipeline.

8.  **`gatsby-browser.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby browser APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/config-files/gatsby-browser/) (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting the browser.

9.  **`gatsby-config.js`**: This is the main configuration file for a Gatsby site. This is where you can specify information about your site (metadata) like the site title and description, which Gatsby plugins you’d like to include, etc. (Check out the [config docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/config-files/gatsby-config/) for more detail).

10.  **`gatsby-node.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby Node APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/config-files/gatsby-node/) (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting pieces of the site build process.

11.  **`gatsby-ssr.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby server-side rendering APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/config-files/gatsby-ssr/) (if any). These allow customization of default Gatsby settings affecting server-side rendering.

12. **`package-lock.json`** (See `package.json` below, first). This is an automatically generated file based on the exact versions of your npm dependencies that were installed for your project. **(You won’t change this file directly).**

13. **`package.json`**: A manifest file for Node.js projects, which includes things like metadata (the project’s name, author, etc). This manifest is how npm knows which packages to install for your project.

14. **`README.md`**: A text file containing useful reference information about your project.

This is app is powered by [Gatsby v4](https://v4.gatsbyjs.com/docs/):

## 🎓 Learning Gatsby

Looking for more guidance? Full documentation for Gatsby lives [on the website](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/). Here are some places to start:

- **For most developers, we recommend starting with our [in-depth tutorial for creating a site with Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/tutorial/).** It starts with zero assumptions about your level of ability and walks through every step of the process.

- **To dive straight into code samples, head [to our documentation](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/).** In particular, check out the _Guides_, _API Reference_, and _Advanced Tutorials_ sections in the sidebar.
